# Guess My Number

Fun little project showing my daughters how to program in JavasScript

## Pick a number between 1 - 20

The game utilizes a randomizer to pick a secret number. Your goal is to guess the correct number within 20 attempts. If you succeed, the background will change to a vibrant green, indicating your victory, and your high score will be showcased on the screen. To challenge yourself again, simply click the "Again" button and see if you can surpass your previous score!
